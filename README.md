The propaganda library is a Clojure implementation of the propagator computational model described in [The Art of the Propagator](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215). The aim of the library is to be easy to use and reason about, yet extensible.

Two different strategies have been implemented: one using the [Clojure STM](http://clojure.org/refs) for handling the propagation of values in the system; and one representing the system as an immutable value, without the aid of any underlying transactional model. The latter approach makes it possible to use propagators from javascript, and is the biggest contribution from this project.

There is a Clojars release containing an implementation that works in both Clojure and ClojureScript.

The leiningen dependency is

    [propaganda "0.2.0"]

## Tutorial

Here follows a short tutorial. For more in depth information, please consult the following sources:

- The `gh-pages` branch of this project contains a brief explanation of the basics of the propagator computational model. The page can be visited [here](http://tgk.github.io/propaganda/).

- [STM vs. System propagation](https://github.com/tgk/propaganda/blob/master/doc/stm_vs_system.md) illustrates the differences between the STM and system approach to propagation using the building height problem.

- [Extending propaganda with set values](https://github.com/tgk/propaganda/blob/master/doc/set_datatype.md) shows how to extend propaganda with support for sets.

- [The Art of the Propagator](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215) contains a more in-depth explanation of how propagation can be implemented.


To use the propaganda library, you need to define a merge, function, create cells and set up propagators. In this short example we just use the default merger function, we define the square and square-root propagator and set up relations beween simple cells.

```clojure
(use 'propaganda.stm)
(use 'propaganda.values)
```

`default-merge` will give us a merger that will merge
nothing with anything, but will enforce that anything else
that is attempted to be merged will return a contradiction
```clojure
(def my-merge
  (default-merge))
```

`nothing` can be merged with `nothing` and will return `nothing`
```clojure
(my-merge nothing nothing)
;; => :propaganda.values/nothing
```

Anything else will be the result of the merge
```clojure
(my-merge nothing 1)
;; => 1
(my-merge 2 nothing)
;; => 2
(my-merge 1 1)
;; => 1
```

... unless it gives rise to a contradiction
```clojure
(my-merge 1 2)
;; => #propaganda.core.Contradiction{:reason "1 != 2"}
```

The `function->propagator-constructor` can be used for setting up
simple one way relations
```clojure
(def squarer
  (function->propagator-constructor
   (fn [val] (* val val))))

(def sqrter
  (function->propagator-constructor
   (fn [val] (Math/sqrt val))))
```

... which can be extended to go both ways
```clojure
(defn quadratic
  [x x-squared]
  (squarer x x-squared)
  (sqrter  x-squared x))
```

We can now construct cells and set up the quadratic relations to read
the squared of a number in our system:
```clojure
(let [x (make-cell)
      x-squared (make-cell)]
  (binding [*merge* my-merge]
    (quadratic x x-squared)
    (add-content x 10.0)
    (get-content x-squared)))
;; => 100.0
```

Or the square-root, depending on the input from the user
```clojure
(let [y (make-cell)
      y-squared (make-cell)]
  (binding [*merge* my-merge]
    (quadratic y y-squared)
    (add-content y-squared 1764.0)
    (get-content y)))
;; => 42.0
```

We will be warned of any inconsistencies in our system when adding
content
```clojure
(let [z (make-cell)
      z-squared (make-cell)]
  (binding [*merge* my-merge]
    (quadratic z z-squared)
    (add-content z 10.0)
    (add-content z-squared 123.0)))
;; Exception: Inconsistency: 100.0 != 123.0
```

## Motivation

The objective of this project is to create an extinsible propagator library for Clojure. Propagators define a declarative computational model. They are described in the article [The Art of the Propagator](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44215).

Along with the library itself, the project should supply documentation of the API, good examples and tutorials.

I have not previously worked with propagtors, so this will also be an exploration for me.
